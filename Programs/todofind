=head1 NAME

todofind - recursively scan Perl source code for TODO comments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  todofind (no arguments)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

todofind scans files and folders recursively,
starting in the current working directory.
Whenever a line of text is found that looks like a Perl comment
with the keyword "TODO" followed by a colon,
todofind outputs a line containing the filename, line number, and comment text.
The output can be processed by the Emacs 'grep' function.

The bottom line is,
if you are a Perl developer who uses Emacs,
you can do M-x grep,
replace the 'grep -nH' with simply 'todofind',
and then you can browse the resulting TODO items in your code base
just like any grep results.

# The default format is suitable for Emacs, ergo no options need to be
# given:
my $o = new Devel::Todo::Find;
# The default is to process Cwd as if it's a Perl module development
# area:
my @a = $o->todos;
print @a;
